# Heatwave VR
Heatwave is the team’s proposal for a VR serious game about climate change, where the player must carefully choose its actions in order to lead the planet into a cooler future. It integrates thermal haptic technologies that go hand in hand with the game narrative and aid in the immersion of the player, as well as contributing to conveying some of the key learning objectives regarding climate change. For this game project, the team has developed and implemented a fully game-ready simplified climate model for Earth for the 21st century that is up-to-date with the latest scientific consensus regarding climate. Added to that, the key game mechanics have also been developed and implemented, ranging from the VR environment, to interaction, and to thermal haptic compatibility; all in all resulting in a pilot game which demonstrates the core ideas and potential of the game while serving as a departure point for a future complete game.

## Project and Team
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, demanding innovative approaches to educate and inspire action. The team of Aalto University Computer, Communication, and Information Sciences (CCIS) master students Saeideh Mansouri, Anh Pham, and Aitor Urruticoechea aims to design and implement an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) game with a thermal haptics counterpart titled “Heatwave”. This project focuses on illustrating the urgency of the climate crisis, where every decision made by individuals can significantly impact the planet and society within the limited time available. By integrating thermal haptics, the game immerses players in a dynamic experience where they physically feel the consequences of global warming, heightening their awareness and sense of urgency.

Through interactive gameplay, "Heatwave" aims to empower diverse users, particularly students, by enhancing their understanding of climate science and fostering critical thinking about environmental issues. This educational VR game not only informs players about the causes and effects of climate change, but crucially
encourages them to explore sustainable solutions through their virtual actions. The aim is to empower the players to take the learnings of the game into real life, prompting meaningful climate action from informed individuals who can assess the real, long-term effects of the actions they undertake.

The project is the culmination of the research, development, and testing undertook by the team under the umbrella provided by the CCIS Masters' course "Special Project in Communications Engineering"; and has been reviewed and evaluated by PhD candidate Tim Moesgen and Professor Yu Xiao. 

## Disclaimers and Further Reading
The project available in this repository presents a pilot game where the core systems and mechanics are implemented; and  the main philosophies and rationale of the game are demonstrated; though as a pilot game it is a technology and idea demonstration and, thus, game-wise, it is incomplete. It is also in a fragile state of version compatibility, specially due to the low maturity state of the thermal haptics API used. For these reasons, **USE ONLY UNREAL ENGINE version 5.4.2**.

Please refer to the project report, avialable in this same repository in PDF format for further reading on the project, game, design, technologies, testing, known issues and limittations, and etcetera.
